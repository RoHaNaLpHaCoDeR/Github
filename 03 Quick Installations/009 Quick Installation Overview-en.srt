1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,233
I have created two sets of installation processes for each tool needed in this course;

2
00:00:05,233 --> 00:00:08,100
an express version, and the complete version.

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:13,100
Since this course is targeted at experienced engineers, this section will provide

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:17,166
a streamlined, express version, of the installation instructions.

5
00:00:17,166 --> 00:00:20,400
This course includes installation instructions for the

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,433
two main operating systems widely used today; Windows, and Mac OS X.

7
00:00:25,433 --> 00:00:30,400
For each operating system, I will provide the list of tools, where to download them,

8
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,266
and any deviations from the default choices during the installation process.

9
00:00:35,266 --> 00:00:39,433
Immediately after the install video, there will be an document lecture

10
00:00:39,433 --> 00:00:45,066
with the installation instructions in tutorial format for those that prefer that approach.

11
00:00:45,066 --> 00:00:50,000
You can choose either lecture, or both, to aid your installation on your system.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,433
For those that prefer the complete and comprehensive videos showing each step

13
00:00:54,433 --> 00:01:02,433
of the installation process for each tool, I have that covered in the bonus section of this course.
