00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In addition to branches, tags, and other labels for commits

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,600
Git has special markers or pointers. One popular marker is called HEAD.

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:13,166
HEAD is normally the last commit of the current branch.

4
00:00:13,166 --> 00:00:17,500
That means that, as we switch branches, the location of HEAD moves

5
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,966
to match the last commit location of that branch.

6
00:00:20,966 --> 00:00:25,266
While this is generally true, it is also possible to manually move

7
00:00:25,266 --> 00:00:29,166
the head location someplace other than the last commit;

8
00:00:29,166 --> 00:00:32,266
we'll cover that in the advanced section of this course.

9
00:00:32,266 --> 00:00:37,833
For now, HEAD points to the last commit of the current branch.
