1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,566
Next, you need to know about the three local states related to files being managed by Git.

2
00:00:05,566 --> 00:00:10,633
There is the working directory, staging area, and Git repository or commit history.

3
00:00:10,633 --> 00:00:16,233
As mentioned before, the working directory contains all the files and folders for your application

4
00:00:16,233 --> 00:00:21,566
which may or may not be managed by Git; either way, Git is aware of those files.

5
00:00:21,566 --> 00:00:26,233
On the other side, we have Git's repository, or commit history,

6
00:00:26,233 --> 00:00:30,800
which contains all the committed or saved changes to the Git repository;

7
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,266
anything here is a part of Git's history. In-between is Git's staging area;

8
00:00:36,266 --> 00:00:39,566
the staging area is used to prepare for the next commit.

9
00:00:39,566 --> 00:00:44,933
Files are moved from the modified working directory state to the Git staging area,

10
00:00:44,933 --> 00:00:48,333
and then finally committed into the Git repository.

11
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:52,666
The three states of Git are specific to the local Git repository.

12
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:56,800
I like to tack on a fourth state; the remote state.

13
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:02,766
Although a remote repository is just another repository with its own three states internally,

14
00:01:02,766 --> 00:01:07,266
conceptually I think of the remote repository as a fourth state

15
00:01:07,266 --> 00:01:10,300
since most people don't consider something truly saved

16
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,433
until it is saved or shared on a remote server.

17
00:01:13,433 --> 00:01:17,466
We will dive into the remote repositories a bit later in this course,

18
00:01:17,466 --> 00:01:23,000
but, for now, we'll stick with the three local states of Git.
