00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,266
Welcome, in this video, we're going to get started by creating a new Git repository locally.

2
00:00:06,266 --> 00:00:12,800
Fire up your terminal, and you can see that I have my standard directories that I have,

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,933
that are part of a new instillation of the Mac operating system.

4
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:19,733
I want to create a location for all the Git projects that we have;

5
00:00:19,733 --> 00:00:23,966
let's create a directory called projects.

6
00:00:23,966 --> 00:00:29,533
Great now the projects folder is there; let's go into it,

7
00:00:29,533 --> 00:00:33,733
as you can see, we're in the projects folder, within the user's home directory.

8
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:39,733
Now, I'm going to use the "git init" command to create a new repository within the projects folder.

9
00:00:39,733 --> 00:00:44,400
Type "git init"; space; and then the name of your project

10
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:49,033
or working folder that you want to create, for this example I'm going to use "demo".

11
00:00:49,033 --> 00:00:55,033
Git responded by saying it initialized an empty Git repository within the "demo" folder.

12
00:00:55,033 --> 00:00:59,200
If I do an "ls", you can see that I have a demo folder.

13
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:03,066
If I go into that folder, my prompt changes to reflect the fact

14
00:01:03,066 --> 00:01:08,900
that I have a Git repository that is on "master"; which is the default branch name

15
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:12,033
that you get whenever you create a new Git repository.

16
00:01:12,033 --> 00:01:18,900
If I do an "ls -al", I can see all the files and folders that are part of this repository.

17
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:24,333
Which, in this case, there are no files or folders other than the default ".git" folder,

18
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:28,500
which is the actual Git repository.
