1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,666
In this video, we're going to continue with our demo repository

2
00:00:03,666 --> 00:00:07,633
by adding some files, and checking the status as we go along.

3
00:00:07,633 --> 00:00:11,500
Any time you want to check out what's going on in the Git repository,

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:17,000
you can use the "git status" command. Since this is a brand new repository,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,133
we are currently building up towards the initial commit.

6
00:00:20,133 --> 00:00:23,533
And we can see that we're on branch master, which incidentally

7
00:00:23,533 --> 00:00:28,066
we also have in parenthesis on our command prompt, and we have nothing to commit,

8
00:00:28,066 --> 00:00:34,000
because we haven't added anything yet. So, let's do that; let's create a file.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,733
Feel free to use the text editor you have configured with your command prompt.

10
00:00:37,733 --> 00:00:41,633
So, I'm going to type "mate"; space; and then a filename to create,

11
00:00:41,633 --> 00:00:45,266
in this case "README", in all caps, ".md".

12
00:00:45,266 --> 00:00:49,466
The ".md" extension is for markdown, which is a popular file format

13
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:52,833
when working with Git repositories. Press enter.

14
00:00:52,833 --> 00:01:01,600
With my text editor, I'm going to go ahead and add some text here.

15
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,666
I started this file out with "Demo Project README" as a first level header.

16
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:11,100
Then, in a regular paragraph, I put "This is a simpler readme file".

17
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:15,700
So, let's save and then close. Now that we've created this new file,

18
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,700
if I do an "ls", you can see the "README.md" file listed.

19
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:23,733
And now, if I do a "git status", I get a very different output;

20
00:01:23,733 --> 00:01:28,666
Git tells me that I'm still on the initial commit, and I have untracked files,

21
00:01:28,666 --> 00:01:34,300
specifically the "README.md" file. It also tells me what I need to do next,

22
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,366
which is use the "add" command, so let's do that:

23
00:01:37,366 --> 00:01:42,933
type "git add", space, and then the file you need to add.

24
00:01:42,933 --> 00:01:47,200
This moves the README file from simply being in our working directory,

25
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,433
unconcerned with Git, into Git's staging area; so press enter.

26
00:01:52,433 --> 00:01:55,800
Now that our README file is in the staging area,

27
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:01,033
we can verify that again with the "git status" command.

28
00:02:01,033 --> 00:02:05,200
Now Git tells us, while we're still building up our initial commit,

29
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,033
that we now have changes to be committed;

30
00:02:08,033 --> 00:02:12,166
that's Git's way of saying that this file is in the Git staging area.

31
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:16,766
Now, we haven't actually committed anything yet, and that's the next step to be made.

32
00:02:16,766 --> 00:02:21,166
So now type "git commit", and for this first example,

33
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:27,133
I'm going to use the "-m" option followed by, in double quotes, a commit message,

34
00:02:27,133 --> 00:02:30,733
to provide a commit message inline on the command prompt;

35
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:36,800
I'm using the commit message, "First file in demo repo". Once you've done that, press enter.

36
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,766
Great, we have a special response from Git for this first commit;

37
00:02:40,766 --> 00:02:46,533
in parenthesis, it tells me that I have the "root-commit", and it gives me a root commit id.

38
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:50,933
It tells me that we changed one file, which is the one file we created,

39
00:02:50,933 --> 00:02:55,033
with three insertions, then it returned to the command prompt.

40
00:02:55,033 --> 00:02:58,566
Now, if I do a "git status", I'm still on master branch,

41
00:02:58,566 --> 00:03:04,600
and I'm back to having nothing to commit since I'm on a clean working directory.
