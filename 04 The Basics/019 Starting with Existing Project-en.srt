00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,666
In this video, we're going to add Git source control to an existing folder.

2
00:00:05,666 --> 00:00:09,500
I'm currently logged into my terminal, in my user's home directory.

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:14,600
I have a projects folder, where I've been putting all my Git projects.

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:19,466
In a previous lesson, we created a Git repository in a Demo folder,

5
00:00:19,466 --> 00:00:22,433
but then we removed the Git repository entirely.

6
00:00:22,433 --> 00:00:27,666
Effectively, what we're left with is a project folder without version control.

7
00:00:27,666 --> 00:00:33,333
So, let's go into our "demo" folder. So, this is where we're at; so I'm within the "demo" folder

8
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:37,400
within our "projects" folder underneath the user's home directory.

9
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:41,733
Here I have a Readme file, and it's currently not in version control.

10
00:00:41,733 --> 00:00:47,800
If I do an "ls -al", which lists all the files and folders including hidden ones,

11
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:52,066
I see there is no ".git" folder to indicate a Git repository.

12
00:00:52,066 --> 00:00:58,233
Also, my prompt reflects the fact that there is no Git repository in this folder or any parents.

13
00:00:58,233 --> 00:01:03,766
To place this folder under version control with Git, we use Git's "init" command;

14
00:01:03,766 --> 00:01:10,166
"git init", and then you can also specify "." to mean this current folder.

15
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:15,800
Great, now Git has initialized an empty Git repository in the current folder.

16
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:22,233
You can see this is signified with a "(master)" within my command prompt.

17
00:01:22,233 --> 00:01:29,766
Also, when I do an "ls -al", we see we have a ".git" folder listed.

18
00:01:29,766 --> 00:01:35,466
Using the "git status" command shows that we have one file that's not being tracked.

19
00:01:35,466 --> 00:01:38,566
If you have been following along, you know that in a previous lesson

20
00:01:38,566 --> 00:01:42,866
that particular file was being tracked by a previous Git repository.

21
00:01:42,866 --> 00:01:45,266
But, since we blew away that repository,

22
00:01:45,266 --> 00:01:49,233
we have a brand-new Git repository, starting completely fresh;

23
00:01:49,233 --> 00:01:56,066
this version of the Git repository has no prior knowledge of that Readme file.
