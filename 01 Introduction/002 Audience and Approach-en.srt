1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,666
This course is target at software engineers, developers, web designers,

2
00:00:04,666 --> 00:00:09,000
and creative professionals that are new to Git and GitHub.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,366
I will cover some more background information in the bonus section,

4
00:00:12,366 --> 00:00:16,900
in order to keep things flowing. This course is mainly focused on GitHub;

5
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:20,400
this course is a great follow up to any course focused on Git,

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,066
but didn't cover GitHub in any great detail.

7
00:00:23,066 --> 00:00:27,133
This course is going to be a bit faster paced than my other courses on Git,

8
00:00:27,133 --> 00:00:29,300
and I assume that you're going to be comfortable with the

9
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:33,666
command line or terminal environment; I'll cover why a bit later.

10
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:40,100
If you prefer something slower-paced, or more in-depth, check out my other courses on Git.

11
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:44,000
This course has been designed to appeal to a wide variety of students

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,833
with different learning styles; I have a little something for everyone in this course.

13
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:54,533
Not everything will appeal to everyone, but I do hope this variety will be well received.

14
00:00:54,533 --> 00:00:58,066
Feel free to skip over content that just isn't your style.

15
00:00:58,066 --> 00:01:01,000
The introduction and core concepts of this course

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,400
contain mainly slides and illustrations with narration;

17
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,233
I have found this to be the best way to introduce theory and concepts.

18
00:01:08,233 --> 00:01:11,866
After that, slides and illustrations are kept to a minimum.

19
00:01:11,866 --> 00:01:16,333
The majority of this course is actually hands-on, step-by-step demonstrations,

20
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:21,400
with you watching my screen in action. These videos are short and to the point;

21
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,300
I only try to cover one, or a handful of concepts, in each one,

22
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:28,300
which keeps the videos focused, and the course flowing.

23
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:31,466
That approach also allows you to jump directly to the videos

24
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:36,400
and topics you are most interested in; however, this course is largely progressive,

25
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,233
which means I build upon prior concepts.

26
00:01:39,233 --> 00:01:42,833
After the core concepts section, I'll drop in some theory when needed,

27
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:45,833
perhaps as a reminder of something we covered before.

28
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:48,500
You will need to follow along as much as possible;

29
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:52,300
you won't learn much from this course if you just passively watch.

30
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,800
Use a second screen, perhaps a tablet, to watch this course

31
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:00,066
while typing the same commands on your system. Pause the videos if needed.

32
00:02:00,066 --> 00:02:04,766
Don't advance to the next video or concept, until you have mastered the current one.

33
00:02:04,766 --> 00:02:08,533
Also, this course will be updated and improved over time;

34
00:02:08,533 --> 00:02:12,800
I plan to add more sections, tips and tricks, quizzes, and exercise projects

35
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,866
in the near future, so check back often.

36
00:02:15,866 --> 00:02:21,100
Finally, you are not alone; I fully support my courses via direct messages,

37
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:27,833
and the discussions. I encourage my students to help each other out as well.
