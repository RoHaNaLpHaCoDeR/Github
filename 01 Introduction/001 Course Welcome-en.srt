00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,233
Hello, I'm Jason Taylor. Welcome to this comprehensive course

2
00:00:04,233 --> 00:00:07,933
on Git source control with the Git Hub hosting service.

3
00:00:07,933 --> 00:00:11,066
This course is specifically designed to quickly cover

4
00:00:11,066 --> 00:00:15,100
the most important concepts in Git, and then focus on GitHub

5
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:18,866
as our remote repository and Git hosting service.

6
00:00:18,866 --> 00:00:21,666
We will cover many other aspects of GitHub,

7
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:27,600
like issue tracking and sharing code with gists. So, let's get started.

8
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:32,166
By the end of this course you should have a solid understanding and command of Git

9
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:36,533
and how to use the GitHub hosting service along with its many features.

10
00:00:36,533 --> 00:00:40,733
To make that happen, we'll start off with the core concepts related to Git.

11
00:00:40,733 --> 00:00:44,533
I provide a quick install section that covers the accelerated

12
00:00:44,533 --> 00:00:48,633
version of my install process for Windows and Mac systems.

13
00:00:48,633 --> 00:00:53,266
If you prefer something more in depth, I have a complete, step by step process

14
00:00:53,266 --> 00:00:57,166
in the corresponding bonus section near the end of this course.

15
00:00:57,166 --> 00:01:01,633
I also provide written instructions for those that prefer that approach.

16
00:01:01,633 --> 00:01:05,833
Once we have an understanding of Git, and installed all the required tools,

17
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:09,100
we can dive right into the foundational Git commands.

18
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:13,366
As we master the basics, you'll learn how to create your first Git project,

19
00:01:13,366 --> 00:01:18,200
make and save changes, and all the standard operations a developer would need.

20
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:23,200
After conquering the fundamentals of Git, we will dive into some more advanced topics,

21
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,900
like comparing, branching, merging, and even a bit of time travel.

22
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:33,333
We dive into the many features of GitHub for the remainder and the majority of this course.

23
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:37,000
That includes using GitHub as our remote repository,

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,566
repository management directly on GitHub,

25
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:43,700
and how to join other projects on GitHub and contribute back to them.

26
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:48,466
After covering the main aspects of GitHub we will look at some of the other features,

27
00:01:48,466 --> 00:01:53,066
like sharing code with gists, tracking defects with GitHub issues,

28
00:01:53,066 --> 00:01:58,866
and grouping related repositories together in organizations.
