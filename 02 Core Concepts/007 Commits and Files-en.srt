00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,500
Git works by saving the current state of all its files it manages into snapshots called commits;

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,133
a commit can contain one or many file changes.

3
00:00:10,133 --> 00:00:14,466
It's important to note that Git versions files, not folders.

4
00:00:14,466 --> 00:00:18,166
Occasionally, you might need to work with a technology that requires

5
00:00:18,166 --> 00:00:22,500
certain folders to exist, regardless of if there are any files there;

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:28,000
if you need to, you can create empty dummy files to force Git to preserve the folder.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,766
As you make changes, commits are saved onto the timeline, known as a branch.

8
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:36,566
A Git repository will normally have at least one branch,

9
00:00:36,566 --> 00:00:39,866
and, by default, that branch is called Master;

10
00:00:39,866 --> 00:00:43,833
additional branches can be created but I will cover that later.

11
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:50,000
For now, our initial work will be done upon the master branch.
