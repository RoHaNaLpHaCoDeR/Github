00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,033
GitHub is a Git repository hosting service provided by GitHub Inc.

2
00:00:05,033 --> 00:00:11,366
Like Bitbucket, GitHub also provides an on-premises hosting solution called GitHub enterprise;

3
00:00:11,366 --> 00:00:16,200
however, I'll be discussing the public GitHub available from "github.com".

4
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:21,500
GitHub has grown to be the most popular Git repository hosting service online.

5
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:26,800
It has the strongest feature set of the online Git hosting services that I've reviewed recently,

6
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,800
making it an easy choice for any developers using Git.

7
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,833
GitHub's main claim to fame is the unlimited free repositories for public repositories.

8
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:40,733
That means that, as long as you don't mind others being able to look at your code,

9
00:00:40,733 --> 00:00:43,500
you can have as many repositories as you want;

10
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:49,000
at the moment you want a private repository, you will have to upgrade to a paid service.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,366
Because of this, most of the open source community has adopted GitHub

12
00:00:53,366 --> 00:00:58,900
as their main repository; even the source code for Git itself is hosted on GitHub.

13
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:04,300
GitHub also boasts many additional features, like issue tracking, web pages,

14
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:09,600
and source code snippet sharing to support developer projects hosted on the service.

15
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,400
All in all, GitHub provides a compelling service that developers can grow with.

16
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,833
Let's get started now.
