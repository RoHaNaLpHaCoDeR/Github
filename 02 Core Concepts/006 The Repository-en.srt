00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,900
Within Git, the collection of version controlled files being managed,

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,766
and their history, is considered the repository.

3
00:00:06,766 --> 00:00:12,600
While we typically think of the collection of files and folders being managed as the repository,

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,800
actually, the encompassing folder on the file system

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,866
is considered the working directory or workspace.

6
00:00:18,866 --> 00:00:22,900
The workspace can contain both files managed by Git and

7
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:28,200
other files and folders being excluded from version control, or not yet managed by Git.

8
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:34,133
Normally, within the root folder of the workspace for your project, there will be a ".git" folder

9
00:00:34,133 --> 00:00:39,133
that contains the actual Git repository; the ".git" folder contains it's

10
00:00:39,133 --> 00:00:44,433
own collection of files and folders that make up the internal structure of the repository.

11
00:00:44,433 --> 00:00:49,766
Since repositories contain all the history of all the files within the repository,

12
00:00:49,766 --> 00:00:54,700
I recommend you keep your Git repositories as narrowly focused as possible.

13
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:59,566
For example, an application might have a Git repository for the front end,

14
00:00:59,566 --> 00:01:04,700
and another one for the back end. At the very least, each application should be in it's

15
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:10,633
own repository and not shared with other applications if possible.
