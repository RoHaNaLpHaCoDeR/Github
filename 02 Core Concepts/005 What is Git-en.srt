00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Git is a decentralized or distributed version control system.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,100
While Git is decentralized, most people still choose to use a central server

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:13,866
to serve as the main repository for a project or team.

4
00:00:13,866 --> 00:00:17,566
Because of the distributed nature, Git can scale massively.

5
00:00:17,566 --> 00:00:23,133
For example, the creator of Git, Linus Torvalds, wanted to create a version control system

6
00:00:23,133 --> 00:00:28,000
that could handle the requirements of the Linux Kernel project, which he also created.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,266
Today, the Linux Kernel project contains over 15 Million lines of code, with over

8
00:00:33,266 --> 00:00:38,733
twelve hundred worldwide developers contributing to the project in dozens of active branches.

9
00:00:38,733 --> 00:00:43,866
Another benefit of being distributed, is that most operations in Git are local;

10
00:00:43,866 --> 00:00:47,333
there are only a few commands that require a Network connection.

11
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:50,000
Otherwise, you can work completely disconnected,

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,866
even preforming comparisons and commits completely off-network.

13
00:00:53,866 --> 00:00:59,166
Since most operations are local, Git is very fast for those same operations.

14
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:04,033
Git is free and open source, which also contributes to its popularity.

15
00:01:04,033 --> 00:01:08,866
Git has a very active community, and there are many resources available online.

16
00:01:08,866 --> 00:01:14,066
Also, it is very easy to find developers that are already experienced with Git.

17
00:01:14,066 --> 00:01:19,200
Because of all these factors, Git has become the most popular version control system.

18
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,566
Git's de-facto standard status means that Git enjoys wide adoption

19
00:01:24,566 --> 00:01:29,500
and integration into other tools used by the software development community.

20
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:36,300
Including text editors, bug tracking systems, and build servers.
