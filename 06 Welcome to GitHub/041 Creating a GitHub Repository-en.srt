1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,533
Welcome, in this video, we're going to sign in to our GitHub account

2
00:00:03,533 --> 00:00:08,700
and create a new repo for us to use with our demo repository on our local system.

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm going to go to my favorite browser, in this case I'm using Google Chrome.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,433
Once the GitHub website loads, go to the "Sign in" button,

5
00:00:15,433 --> 00:00:18,466
and let's sign into our account if we're not already logged in.

6
00:00:18,466 --> 00:00:20,966
Once you've filled in your credentials, click "Sign in".

7
00:00:20,966 --> 00:00:25,400
Once you've logged into your account, click on the green "New repository" button.

8
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,700
On the create repository page, make sure that the owner is you,

9
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,566
and, for repository name, I'm just going to type "demo".

10
00:00:31,566 --> 00:00:36,733
GitHub is going to verify that the name "demo" is unique within my owner space.

11
00:00:36,733 --> 00:00:39,800
We can give this repository an optional description,

12
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:45,033
so I'm going to use "This is a demo repository". I'm going to leave this repository as public

13
00:00:45,033 --> 00:00:48,566
since private repositories would require a paid account.

14
00:00:48,566 --> 00:00:52,366
I'm going to leave the rest of the options unchecked or set to "None".

15
00:00:52,366 --> 00:00:55,400
Now click the green "Create repository" button.

16
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:59,133
Great, once the repository's been created, you'll land on a page like this,

17
00:00:59,133 --> 00:01:02,433
giving you several instructions. Since we don't have any source code

18
00:01:02,433 --> 00:01:06,300
already associated with this repository, we will need to associate

19
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:13,166
our existing local repository with our newly created remote repository
