00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Welcome, in this video, we're going to take a few minutes to set up our account on GitHub.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,866
As you can see, where I'm at now is on the GitHub website, signed into my account.

3
00:00:09,866 --> 00:00:13,733
If you're not already signed in, go to the GitHub website and sign in now.

4
00:00:13,733 --> 00:00:17,066
Once you have signed in and arrived on the newsfeed page,

5
00:00:17,066 --> 00:00:21,000
go to the upper right-hand side where you see view profile and more.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,600
Click the drop-down next to it; click on "Your profile".

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,166
This is a general summary page for your profile,

8
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:29,833
which includes contributions you have made over time.

9
00:00:29,833 --> 00:00:32,833
And, since this is a new account, there aren't any at this point.

10
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:37,733
It also shows repositories and public activity, both of which will be empty at this point;

11
00:00:37,733 --> 00:00:40,633
however, what we want is to click on "Edit profile".

12
00:00:40,633 --> 00:00:44,233
Once we're on the public profile page, let's fill in this information,

13
00:00:44,233 --> 00:00:47,233
so as we contribute to other repositories in the future,

14
00:00:47,233 --> 00:00:52,300
people will know a little bit more about us and thus will most likely trust whatever we contribute.

15
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,033
First, let's start off by uploading a profile picture.

16
00:00:55,033 --> 00:00:57,666
Under profile picture, click "Upload new picture".

17
00:00:57,666 --> 00:01:00,500
I happen to have my picture over here on my desktop.

18
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,200
So, I'm going to select "Desktop", and then select my picture, which is a ".jpg".

19
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:08,633
Then, I'm going to click on "Open". I'm going to be granted the opportunity to crop my picture;

20
00:01:08,633 --> 00:01:11,366
I'm going to move it down just a little bit, and that looks good to me.

21
00:01:11,366 --> 00:01:15,766
So, once I'm happy with the crop, I'm going to click on the "Set new profile picture".

22
00:01:15,766 --> 00:01:19,033
Great, you can see that the profile picture has been updated,

23
00:01:19,033 --> 00:01:23,100
and now I can continue filling out the rest of this form, starting with the name.

24
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,566
I can choose to show my email address or not.

25
00:01:26,566 --> 00:01:29,633
Under URL, if you have a personal website address,

26
00:01:29,633 --> 00:01:33,766
or you want to advertise your company's address, put the website address here.

27
00:01:33,766 --> 00:01:37,566
If you have a company name, you can put it there, but it's also optional.

28
00:01:37,566 --> 00:01:40,400
In location, you can put anything you want in this field,

29
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,866
which means you can completely lie about your location if you choose to do so,

30
00:01:43,866 --> 00:01:47,733
but generally people prefer it if you actually tell them generally where you're at.

31
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:51,633
You don't have to put down to the street level or anything that would be too revealing.

32
00:01:51,633 --> 00:01:53,533
I'm just going to leave it at the city level,

33
00:01:53,533 --> 00:01:57,066
which I'm currently in Orlando, Florida in the United States.

34
00:01:57,066 --> 00:02:00,966
Once you've updated that part of the profile, click on "Update profile".

35
00:02:00,966 --> 00:02:03,766
This page will refresh, providing a notice, letting you know

36
00:02:03,766 --> 00:02:07,300
that the profile has been successfully updated. I'm going to cancel that.

37
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:11,466
And, under personal settings, we're going to continue working down these personal settings

38
00:02:11,466 --> 00:02:15,033
to set up our profile as accurately as possible.

39
00:02:15,033 --> 00:02:17,666
Of course, whatever you choose to provide is fine,

40
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:23,033
and if there are things you prefer not to provide, that's OK too.
