1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Welcome, in this video, we're going to continue filling out our personal settings.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,200
I'm currently logged into GitHub, and I'm currently on the public profile page,

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,233
which we just finished filling out. I'm not going to go through every single item here

4
00:00:13,233 --> 00:00:16,700
in the personal settings menu, but we're going to hit the highlights.

5
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,200
Let's go to account settings.

6
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,466
Account settings will allow us to change a password if we choose to.

7
00:00:21,466 --> 00:00:24,666
Also, if we don't like our username, we can change it here.

8
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:29,100
And, if for some reason, you just really don't like GitHub, you can delete your account.

9
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:32,000
Under emails, you'll start off with the email address that you

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
provided when you signed up. If you choose to, you can add additional emails.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,433
Once you provide an email address, click add.

12
00:00:38,433 --> 00:00:41,966
GitHub will send a verification email to that email address.

13
00:00:41,966 --> 00:00:45,733
Until it's been verified, you'll have this badge next to your email address,

14
00:00:45,733 --> 00:00:48,733
signifying that it's unverified. If, for some reason,

15
00:00:48,733 --> 00:00:52,733
you don't receive the email for verification, you can click the "Resend" button,

16
00:00:52,733 --> 00:00:57,433
or if you don't want your email address linked with GitHub, you can click the delete button.

17
00:00:57,433 --> 00:00:59,733
Alright, let's move on to notification center.

18
00:00:59,733 --> 00:01:05,166
Notification center is how we control what notifications we receive, and how we receive them.

19
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:07,766
By default, almost everything is checked for you.

20
00:01:07,766 --> 00:01:11,200
So, you can go in and say that I don't want something in a certain way.

21
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,266
For example, you want notifications when you participate in a conversation

22
00:01:15,266 --> 00:01:17,866
or someone brings you through an "@mention".

23
00:01:17,866 --> 00:01:22,200
You could decide that you don't want an email for that, but you want to leave the web setting,

24
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,833
which means when you log in, it'll show up under notifications.

25
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:28,566
Under "Watching", you may decide you don't want either one,

26
00:01:28,566 --> 00:01:30,866
just un-check the options you don't want.

27
00:01:30,866 --> 00:01:33,766
And then, if you have multiple email addresses, you can choose

28
00:01:33,766 --> 00:01:36,700
which email addresses you want for your notification.

29
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:41,033
On this page, all the updates are done automatically, so there's no need to save anything.

30
00:01:41,033 --> 00:01:43,033
Moving along, let's go to billing.

31
00:01:43,033 --> 00:01:46,900
Since we're on the free account, there's no need to fill out any billing information.

32
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,966
If, in the future, you choose to move up to a paid account,

33
00:01:49,966 --> 00:01:52,833
this is the page that you would fill in your payment information

34
00:01:52,833 --> 00:01:55,966
as well as provide any coupon codes if you have them.

35
00:01:55,966 --> 00:01:58,933
We're going to cover SSH keys later, and on security,

36
00:01:58,933 --> 00:02:01,766
we can enable two-factor authentication.

37
00:02:01,766 --> 00:02:04,466
Two-factor authentication is a little bit more advanced,

38
00:02:04,466 --> 00:02:09,366
and I recommend you read the information on two-factor authentication before you enable it.

39
00:02:09,366 --> 00:02:13,166
Also, on the security page, it shows the sessions that we have,

40
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:17,833
and it shows a history of the various actions we've taken, especially with the profile.

41
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:20,066
The rest of these items are a little bit more advanced,

42
00:02:20,066 --> 00:02:22,166
and we will get to them in later videos.

43
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:24,500
For now, we're done with our personal settings,

44
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:29,033
so let's click on the octocat icon to return back to our newsfeed page,

45
00:02:29,033 --> 00:02:34,633
which is the page we're normally greeted with when we first log in to GitHub.
