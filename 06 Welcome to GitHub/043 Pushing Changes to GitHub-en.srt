00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,100
Welcome, in this video, we're going to push up all our changes that we have

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:08,566
on our demo Git repository up to our newly created GitHub repository.

3
00:00:08,566 --> 00:00:14,066
I'm currently in my "demo" Git repository on a clean working directory, on the master branch.

4
00:00:14,066 --> 00:00:17,566
In a previous video, we associated the local repository

5
00:00:17,566 --> 00:00:20,766
with a remote repository we created on GitHub.

6
00:00:20,766 --> 00:00:23,700
Now, it's time to push up all our changes to GitHub.

7
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:28,300
In order to synchronize our changes between the local Git repository

8
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:32,266
and the remote Git repository, we're going to use Git's push command.

9
00:00:32,266 --> 00:00:34,800
Now, I've typed out the command that we're going to use,

10
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,933
so let me explain it before we press enter. We start off with "git push",

11
00:00:38,933 --> 00:00:44,100
followed by the "-u" option, which is going to set up a tracking branch relationship

12
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,300
between the master branch on the local repository,

13
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:52,500
and the master branch on the remote repository. And, we'll see this after we press enter.

14
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,900
After the "-u" parameter, we have the name of the remote repository

15
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:00,200
that we're going to use in order to push up our changes.

16
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:05,633
Since the only repository we have is named "origin", that's the value we're going to use.

17
00:01:05,633 --> 00:01:10,166
If you named your remote repository something else, then you would use that name instead.

18
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:13,533
After the name of our remote repository, we need to provide

19
00:01:13,533 --> 00:01:15,900
the name of the branch we're going to push up;

20
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,966
and, in this case, the branch we're going to use is named "master".

21
00:01:19,966 --> 00:01:24,500
After that, we're going to use the "--tags" flag to send all the tags

22
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:28,333
that we have currently in our Git repository up to GitHub.

23
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:30,766
Double check that line, and then press enter.

24
00:01:30,766 --> 00:01:34,233
You will be prompted for your username and then password for GitHub;

25
00:01:34,233 --> 00:01:36,866
provide those settings and press enter.

26
00:01:36,866 --> 00:01:40,700
If everything is successful, you should have a screen that looks like this.

27
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:44,000
The first few lines are some housekeeping that Git does

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,133
in order to synchronize objects between local and remote repositories.

29
00:01:48,133 --> 00:01:50,466
What's important are the lines towards the bottom,

30
00:01:50,466 --> 00:01:54,566
where we start off with "to", and then the URL to our GitHub repository.

31
00:01:54,566 --> 00:01:58,300
Underneath that, we have our new branch, which is "master->master".

32
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:02,333
Which technically means that our remote repository, that is on GitHub,

33
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:05,300
started out without any type of a branch.

34
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:09,033
So, when we pushed, we created that first branch called master.

35
00:02:09,033 --> 00:02:13,366
After that, we pushed up our one and only tag to GitHub as well.

36
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:18,600
Finally, at the end, Git tells us that we set up a tracking branch relationship between

37
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:24,266
the master branch on the local repository with the master branch on the GitHub repository.

38
00:02:24,266 --> 00:02:29,933
When we do pushes in the future, the "-u" will no longer be required.
