00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,166
In this video, we're going to validate our changes that we just pushed up to GitHub.

2
00:00:05,166 --> 00:00:09,666
We just completed our first push up to GitHub on our "demo" repository.

3
00:00:09,666 --> 00:00:12,600
So, let's go see if our changes made it up to GitHub.

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:16,266
Return to our browser and now we should be able to refresh this page

5
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:18,900
or just click on the name of the repository.

6
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,600
Great, if everything made it up to GitHub, your screen should look similar to this.

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,233
Feel free to scroll up and down to see the contents of this page.

8
00:00:27,233 --> 00:00:31,700
GitHub starts us off by listing out the files that are available on our repository,

9
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:36,800
and if there's a README.md file, GitHub will automatically display the contents

10
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,733
of that Readme file using the Markdown syntax, rendering it out like this.

11
00:00:41,733 --> 00:00:46,633
If I click on commits, you can see the commit history from our repository.

12
00:00:46,633 --> 00:00:49,733
If I go to release, then click on tags,

13
00:00:49,733 --> 00:00:53,700
you can see that we have our v1.0 tag already on GitHub.

14
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,733
Great, now that we've verified that we have

15
00:00:55,733 --> 00:01:00,766
synchronized our repository on GitHub, we can move forward.
