1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,966
Welcome, in this video, I'm going to sign up for a GitHub account.

2
00:00:04,966 --> 00:00:10,066
Fire up your favorite browser, in my case I'm using Google Chrome.

3
00:00:10,066 --> 00:00:12,866
If you don't have an existing account on GitHub,

4
00:00:12,866 --> 00:00:16,433
use the form on the GitHub homepage to set up your account.

5
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:20,733
In my case, I want to select "jasongtaylor" as my username,

6
00:00:20,733 --> 00:00:24,833
which GitHub automatically searches for to make sure it's unique in the system.

7
00:00:24,833 --> 00:00:28,566
I provide my email address, which is jason@git.training;

8
00:00:28,566 --> 00:00:32,933
GitHub will verify that this email address is not currently being used on the system.

9
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:36,700
And then, finally, I provide the password that I'm going to use for my account.

10
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:40,266
Below, you can see GitHub's recommendation for passwords,

11
00:00:40,266 --> 00:00:44,933
which is at least one lowercase letter, one numeral, and at least seven characters.

12
00:00:44,933 --> 00:00:47,966
Once you've filled in the form, and have three check marks,

13
00:00:47,966 --> 00:00:50,733
go ahead and click on the green "Sign up for GitHub".

14
00:00:50,733 --> 00:00:54,066
At this point, you technically already have a GitHub account;

15
00:00:54,066 --> 00:00:59,100
however, as part of the sign up process, GitHub is going to ask you a few additional questions,

16
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,200
like whether or not you want to sign up for a paid account.

17
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,433
However, we don't need to sign up for a paid account for this course.

18
00:01:05,433 --> 00:01:08,766
By default, free will be chosen; you only need the other accounts

19
00:01:08,766 --> 00:01:13,200
if you plan to be working with closed or private repos within a team.

20
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,766
At the bottom of the screen, you'll see "Help me set up an organization next".

21
00:01:16,766 --> 00:01:19,866
We'll leave this unchecked; we'll hit organizations later.

22
00:01:19,866 --> 00:01:23,533
Then click "Finish sign up". Great, you have finished signing up for GitHub,

23
00:01:23,533 --> 00:01:26,600
and this is the introduction page that you get once you sign up.

24
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,733
Let me go ahead and x out; once you do that, you'll see that we're on the newsfeed page.

25
00:01:30,733 --> 00:01:32,933
And now, just to get back to a consistent level,

26
00:01:32,933 --> 00:01:36,966
let's go ahead and sign out of this account. Go over to the profile,

27
00:01:36,966 --> 00:01:40,933
once you arrow down to expand the menu, go all the way down to "Sign out".

28
00:01:40,933 --> 00:01:44,100
This will return you back to the main homepage for GitHub.

29
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:48,100
Next, we'll click on "Sign in" to make sure that we set up our account properly,

30
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,933
and we know how to get into our account.

31
00:01:49,933 --> 00:01:54,933
On the sign in page, fill out your username or email address, and then your password.

32
00:01:54,933 --> 00:01:59,600
Once you've filled out your username or email address, and password, click "Sign in".

33
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:06,666
Great, if you land on this page, which is your newsfeed page, you have successfully signed in.
