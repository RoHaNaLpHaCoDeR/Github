00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,866
Welcome, in this section, we will get an introduction to the GitHub hosting service.

2
00:00:04,866 --> 00:00:09,933
So far, we have been working exclusively on our local system, but now

3
00:00:09,933 --> 00:00:14,866
it's time to publish our code somewhere others can see it, and potentially contribute to it.

4
00:00:14,866 --> 00:00:19,366
The most popular hosting service for Git repositories is GitHub.

5
00:00:19,366 --> 00:00:22,600
GitHub has become the most popular Git hosting service

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,633
largely because of the free account it offers,

7
00:00:25,633 --> 00:00:31,200
which includes public repositories, along with its long list of powerful features.

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:36,133
GitHub does have a paid service for those that need private repositories too.

9
00:00:36,133 --> 00:00:41,766
For this course, we will be staying with the public repositories, so the free account will be fine.

10
00:00:41,766 --> 00:00:45,166
During this section, we will walk through signing up for GitHub

11
00:00:45,166 --> 00:00:47,500
for those that don't already have an account.

12
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,133
Once everyone has an account and signed in,

13
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:53,600
we will review the GitHub user profile and settings,

14
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,066
and then create our first repository on GitHub.

15
00:00:56,066 --> 00:00:58,700
With our newly created repository on GitHub,

16
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:04,800
we will link up our local repository, and send everything up to GitHub.
